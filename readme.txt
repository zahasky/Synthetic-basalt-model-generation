This folder contains the Matlab codes and functions to generate synthetic vesicular basalt models and calculate resulting surface area and porosity. 
The file 'basalt_pore_connectivity_simulator' is the base code for the synthetic basalt model generator without microporosity. This works by iteratively added vesicles randomly to a 3D volume and calculting surface area and porosity as vesicles are added.
The file 'basalt_pore_connectivity_simulator' is an adapted version of 'basalt_pore_connectivity_simulator.m' for the generating synthetic basalt models with microporosity. This works in the same way by iteratively added vesicles randomly to a 3D volume and calculting effective porosity as vesicles are added. NOTE THAT SURFACE AREA CALCULATIONS ARE UNTESTED as there was not enough experimental information about microporous surface area to properly benchmark these  types of simulation results.
